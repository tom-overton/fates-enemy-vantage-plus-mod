# fates-enemy-vantage-plus-mod

This repo can be built using [Magikoopa](https://github.com/RicBent/Magikoopa/tree/master) to create a mod for Fire Emblem Fates such that enemies will always strike first when attacked, even on player phase. This is reminiscent of the Vantage+ skill in Awakening, hence the name of the mod. However, unlike in Awakening, this skill is innate and will not take up a skill slot; in that regard, it is like the ["Lunatic Reverse" difficulty mode](https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty#Lunatic%E2%80%B2_Mode) of FE12.

This mod only supports the US Special Edition of Fire Emblem Fates. I have no plans to ever make this work with any other version of the game. It wouldn't be too hard to figure out the addresses for everything if you want to do it yourself, though.

## Installation

Download the latest release and unzip the contents. What to do next depends on where you want to play the mod:

### For playing the mod on Citra

- Right click your copy of Fire Emblem Fates in Citra and select "Open Mods Location"
- Copy `code.bps` and `exheader.bin` from the unzipped file to the folder that appears. Do ***not*** copy `code.ips` into that folder!

### For playing the mod on real hardware using Luma3DS
- From the root of your 3DS's SD card, navigate to `luma/titles/0004000000179800`. If any of those folders do not exist, create them.
- Copy `code.ips` and `exheader.bin` from the unzipped file to the folder that appears. Do ***not*** copy `code.bps` into that folder!

## Building

- Download or build your own copy of [Magikoopa](https://github.com/RicBent/Magikoopa/tree/master) (I got mine from [this forum post](https://nsmbhd.net/thread/4631-magikoopa-code-patcher-for-3ds-games/), but I think it's quite out-of-date).
- Extract a copy of `code.bin` and `exheader.bin` from the US Special Edition of Fire Emblem Fates (make sure `code.bin` is decompressed). Place these two files in the root folder of the repository.
- Open Magikoopa and select "File" -> "Set Working Directory". Set the working directory to be the root of the repository.
- Click the "Make and Insert" button.

A patched version of `code.bin` and `exheader.bin` will now be present in the root of the repository. You can use these as-is just by dropping them in the root title ID directory.
